/**
 * Explores responses to edge cases such as server errors and hangs.
 * We do mocking at the jclouds level, rather than using (say) S3Mock, because:
 * <ul>
 * <li>We are interested here in the behavior of the generic Jenkins integration code in this package,
 *     as well as its dependencies in Jenkins core and Pipeline, not that of a particular blob store.
 * <li>S3-specific failure modes are of interest but are generally hard to simulate using those mock frameworks anyway.
 *     For example, some S3 mock frameworks completely ignore authentication.
 *     Conversely, some failure modes we want to test may not be supported by an S3 mock framework.
 * <li>S3 mock frameworks are not written to expect the jclouds abstraction layer, and vice-versa.
 *     The jclouds {@code AWSS3ProviderMetadata} cannot accept a custom {@link AmazonS3} which {@code S3MockRule} would supply;
 *     it reimplements the S3 REST API from scratch, not using the AWS SDK.
 *     It would be necessary to run Dockerized mocks with local HTTP ports.
 * </ul>
